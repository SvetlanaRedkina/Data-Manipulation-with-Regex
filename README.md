# Data Manipulation with RegEx

Regex, or Regular Expressions, is an amazing sequence of characters that comes in handy when we need quickly retrieve data

I wanted to learn how to filter out data efficiently using RegEx in MySQL, so I came with the idea of this project

## Project structure

- CustomerInfo.sql contains a table CustomerInfo
  
  I import the dataset from Customers.csv. Otherwise, it would be rather tiresome to insert values into CustomersInfo table

  Screenshot_CustomerInfo_MySQL_Import.png shows how CustomerInfo table looks in MySQL after I have imported the values into it

- CustomerInfo.sql is the core of the Project

  It contains 16 problems. I use Regex to solve each problem in order to illustrate how useful Regex can be in data sorting
 
  Please, note that there might be other ways to solve the problems
