## Data Manipulation with RegEx 🔣 

RegEx, also known as Regular Expressions, is an amazing sequence of characters 👏 that comes in handy when we need to quickly retrieve data. I wanted to learn how to filter out data efficiently using RegEx in MySQL, so I came up with an idea of this project.


### Project structure

- The CustomerInfo.sql contains a table called CustomerInfo. I import the dataset from the Customers.csv. Otherwise, it would be rather tiresome 😒 to insert values into the CustomersInfo table. The Screenshot_CustomerInfo_MySQL_Import.png shows how the CustomerInfo table looks like in MySQL after I have imported the values into it.

- The CustomerInfo.sql is the core 💥 of my Project. It contains 16 problems. I use Regex to solve each problem in order to explain how useful RegEx can be while data sorting. Please, note that there might be other solutions to the problems 😊.
