## Data Manipulation with RegEx 🔣 

Regex, or Regular Expressions, is an amazing sequence of characters 👏 that comes in handy when we need quickly retrieve data. I wanted to learn how to filter out data efficiently using RegEx in MySQL, so I came up with an idea of this project.


### Project structure

- CustomerInfo.sql contains a table CustomerInfo. I import the dataset from Customers.csv. Otherwise, it would be rather tiresome 😒 to insert values into CustomersInfo table. Screenshot_CustomerInfo_MySQL_Import.png shows how CustomerInfo table looks like in MySQL after I have imported the values into it.

- CustomerInfo.sql is the core 💥 of the Project. It contains 16 problems. I use Regex to solve each problem in order to illustrate how useful Regex can be in data sorting. Please, note that there might be other ways to solve the problems 😊.
