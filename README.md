## Project structure

- CustomerInfo.sql contains a table CustomerInfo
  
  I import the dataset from Customers.csv. Otherwise, it would be rather tiresome to insert values into CustomersInfo table

  Screenshot_CustomerInfo_MySQL_Import.png shows how CustomerInfo table looks in MySQL after I have imported the values into it

- CustomerInfo.sql is the core of the Project

  It contains 16 problems. I use Regex to solve each problem in order to illustrate how useful Regex can be in data sorting
 
  Please, note that there might be other ways to solve the problems
